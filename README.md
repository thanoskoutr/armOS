## About
This simple Operating System (kernel) is inspired and based on the Linux kernel, especially the ARM specific architecture parts. The features of the kernel are presented in detail in a later section. The main focus of this project, was to dive deep into core OS related concepts (such as the scheduler, drivers, handling processes/memory) and get to know the hardware and low level features of ARM embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi.

The other focus of this project, was to explore both the `Aarch32` and `Aarch64` ARM states developing the OS using the ARMv6/ARMv7-a and the ARMv8-a architecture respectively. The 32-bit version is the older and more widespreed architecture in embedded devices, but the 64-bit version is a more powerfull, modern and secure architecture with lots of differences from the old one.

- The `Aarch32` version was tested on the Raspberry Pi Zero W, but it should work with minor changes to the Raspberry Pi 2 and the original Pi.
- Then `Aarch64` version was tested on the Raspberry Pi 4, but it should work with minor changes to the Raspberry Pi 3.

## Documentation
There is proper documentation available for the project in two different formats:

- In the [GitHub Pages](https://thanoskoutr.github.io/armOS/) of the project's GitHub repository.
- In the [Wiki section](https://github.com/thanoskoutr/armOS/wiki) of the project's GitHub repository.

### Doxygen Documentation
There is detailed documentation of all the source code, generated by [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl), describing all the structures and functions of the project.

**NOTE:** The documentation is generated either for the Rasperry Pi 4 or the Raspberry Pi Zero / Zero W. They have some differences mainly regarding the register addresses, but they are mostly identical.

### Wiki Documentation
There are specific details about the implementation of most major parts of the OS, and guides for installing the dependencies and running the OS on a Pi.

## Project Structure
The project structure for the source code is the following:
```
├── arch
│   ├── armv6
│   ├── armv7-a
│   └── armv8-a
├── armstub
│   └── src
├── include
│   ├── armv6
│   ├── armv8-a
│   ├── common
│   ├── kernel
│   └── peripherals
└── src
    ├── common
    └── kernel
```
The `include/` directory contains definitions of structures and functions:

- `kernel/`: For the core features of the kernel.
- `armv6/` and `armv8-a/`: For architecture specific routines implemented in ARM assembly code.
- `common/`: For common libraries such as `string.h` and `stdlib.h` needed for the kernel.
- `peripherals/`: For the register's addresses for the peripherals of the devices, in order to provide basic drivers for them.

The `src/` directory contains the implementations of the functions defined in the `include/` directory.

The `arch/` directory contains the implementations of the architecture specific routines implemented in ARM assembly code, separated based on the ARM architecture.

The `armstub/` directory contains a simple bootloader for the ARMv-8 architecture, in order to boot the kernel in the proper [Exception Level](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/102412/0100/Privilege-and-Exception-levels).

- Implementation of basic library functions:
    - [x] `string.h`
    - [x] `stdlib.h`
    - [x] `stdbool.h`
    - [x] `printk()`
- Exception Level handling for the ARMv-8 architecture:
    - [x] Setting kernel at EL 1.
- Handling Interrupts - Exceptions:
    - [x] Initialize vector table.
    - [x] Handles Timer and UART IRQs.
- Scheduler and processes:
    - [x] Creates and kills processes.
    - [x] Schedules them in order to run multiple processes concurrently.
    - [x] Performs Context Switching for the execution of different processes.
- Implementation of basic serial console:
    - [x] Communication with users through serial input and output.
    - [x] Available commands to execute.

Features to be implemented in the near feature:

- System Calls
- Proper Virtual memory management
- Video drivers
